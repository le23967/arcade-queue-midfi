/* Plan a session.

   Consultation feedback was that presence only pays off when it lets you
   arrange something: knowing where people are is not engagement until it turns
   into a time and a place. This screen is that turn.

   Venue, game, time, and who you are asking - then it lands on their Circle
   tab as an invitation.

   When used to be three hardcoded strings, which is fine for clicking through
   a demo and useless for planning anything: the screen could not express next
   Thursday. Choosing a date and time is therefore the main control: the date
   uses the platform's familiar typed/calendar field, while hour and minute can
   be typed or moved with phone-style wheels. Common times remain as clearly
   labelled shortcuts rather than being mixed with the custom choice.

   Who can come is a choice of its own. Asking the people you follow is the
   default, and it is also useless to somebody whose list is empty - which
   every player is on their first day, and which the interviews suggest the
   introverted ones stay for a long time. Opening a session to anyone on the
   app is the way round that: it is posted on Open, where people you have
   never met can see it and say they are in. The host still decides. Nothing
   about a closed session changes.

   The people here are real accounts: the ones you follow, and anyone you
   search for by username. Sessions themselves are still kept on this phone,
   so asking someone would have reached nobody - which is the kind of button
   this project has been removing. So each real person you ask gets the
   session as a message, through the same conversation their profile opens:
   an ordinary message if you follow each other, a request if not. What they
   get is the plan in one line and the question; what you get is a
   conversation to settle it in. */
