/* Circle tab. Four views over the same community, one per question.

   The underlying request was "seeing where your friends are and all of that",
   and the temporal half of it - whether you have just missed someone - is what
   Activity answers.

   Consultation feedback drove two changes. First, every row now ends in
   something you can do: knowing where someone is only counts once it lets you
   join them, ask them about the venue, or arrange to meet. Second, the map
   view exists at all - people were only ever in a list before.

   There were six segments for a while, and the bar no longer fit the width.
   Two of them were the same question drawn twice: Map and Now both answered
   "who is out", one as pins and one as rows, and Later and Open both answered
   "what is coming up", one for your circle and one for anyone. Each pair is
   one segment now, with the second answer a step inside the first - a list
   sheet over the map, and a filter on Later. The segment bar is the first
   thing on the tab, so it is the first thing to say what the tab is for, and
   four questions is what it is for.

   Open sessions are the one thing here not scoped to the people you follow.
   Every other view is empty for a player with no mutuals, and the app was
   telling that player, in effect, to come back once they had friends - which
   is backwards, since making them is what they are here for. */

   Future, not live. These used to sit at the top of Here now with no label of

   segment of their own now, and every row states what put it in front of you:
   you arranged it, you were invited, how you know the host, or that the host
   opened it to anyone.

   Two scopes, one filter. Your circle is the sessions you arranged, were
   asked to, said yes to, or that someone you follow is hosting. Open to
   anyone is the public half: every session anyone has posted for anyone,
   whether or not you have ever heard of them. Open used to be a segment of
   its own, which made two top-level answers to one question.

   Open is also the whole tab for a player with nobody in their circle yet.
   Nothing about presence changes for it - nobody is located, nobody is
   approached. A host who posts an open session has chosen to be found, the
   same way a note on the arcade's pinboard would, and saying you are in is
