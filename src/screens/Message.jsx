/* A conversation.

   An earlier version deliberately had no contact action at all, on the team's
   own finding that "the app can't force our users to just go up to someone
   they haven't met". That was about strangers, and the shape of it still
   holds: a stranger gets one message, which arrives as a request, and the
   other person decides whether it becomes a conversation. Between people
   who follow each other it is an ordinary thread from the first word.

   The messages are real. This screen does not know or care where they come
   from - it is handed a list, a mode that says what belongs at the bottom,
   and a line to show under the name - so the same screen shows a live
   thread with another account and a closed one with a seeded sample player.
   Nothing here claims a status the database has not recorded.

   The bottom of the screen is the mode:

     chat              the composer
     request-compose   the composer, and a line saying the first message
                       goes as a request
     request-sent      what you sent, and that it is waiting on them
     request-received  their message, and Accept / Decline / Block
     blocked           you blocked them; the way back is on their profile
     closed            no composer, for a reason given in `closedNote`

   It is a thread rather than a send box because the first version replaced
   the composer with "Sent" and a Done button, and then forgot the message.

   It is a screen rather than a sheet because a conversation is a place you
   go to, not a panel that covers where you were: it can be long, and the
   keyboard needs the room. The inbox is the sheet; this is what it opens.

   Two ways out, because they are two different intents. The cross at the
   right closes this conversation and returns to whatever opened it - the
   inbox sheet, or a profile. The arrow at the left leaves messaging
   altogether and lands on the tab: the first version sent it back to the
   inbox as well, and someone who had finished talking found themselves
   looking at a list they had not asked for. */
