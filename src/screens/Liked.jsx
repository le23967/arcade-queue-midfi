/* Liked clips.

   This lives under Me rather than under Watch, on purpose.

   Watch is a lean-back surface: one clip at a time, served to you, in order.
   Finding something you saved is the opposite task - you have a specific thing
   in mind and you are going to retrieve it. Those two want different shapes,
   and folding the saved list into Watch's segmented control would have mixed
   two content SOURCES with one saved STATE in the same control.

   Me is already the tab for things that belong to you: your sessions, your
   reports, who you follow, your songs. Liked clips fit that model without
   changing what the tab means. It is also where Instagram and TikTok both put
   theirs, so it is where people look first.

   A grid, because these are videos. It was a text list - a small grey block
   with the handle, the song, the achievement and a grade chip beside it -
   which is the shape you give to records, not to things you watch. Retrieval
   here is visual: you remember the run, not its percentage. Three to a row is
   what every video library people already use does, and a tile at that size
   still carries the song, its length and how it went down. */
