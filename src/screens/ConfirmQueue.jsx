/* Check-in, step two: confirm what you can see.

   Reporting used to be a second button sitting next to Check In at the same
   visual weight, which is wrong twice over - it competes with the primary
   action, and it asks for a report at a moment when the person is not
   necessarily looking at the queue.

   This is the moment they are. They have just scanned at the cabinet, so they
   are standing in front of the line and can count it. The steppers arrive
   pre-filled with the last report, so if it is already right this stays a
   single tap, which is the bar check-in has to clear: the arcade's paper queue
   board failed because anything slower than one tap gets skipped.

   The payoff is that every check-in now carries a verified count rather than a
   blind +1 on top of a number nobody has confirmed.

   It asks for pairs and solo players because that is what the arcade page
   shows, and what a person standing at the cabinet can actually count. Asking
   for "parties" here and displaying "pairs" there described the same line two
   different ways - and a solo player is a party but not a pair, so the two
   readings did not even line up. The party total is derived rather than
   entered. */
