   Social layer seed data.

   Scope is deliberately narrow. Only three things in the interviews had a
   participant volunteer them without being prompted with a concept first:

   - the 20-person favourite cap on the official maimai score site
   - being able to see which players are around
   - what game someone mainly plays, and what songs they like

   Everything else in the social space (matchmaking with strangers, icebreaker
   prompts, invite rewards) came out of the team's own brainstorm, so it is not
   built here. See README for the evidence grading.

/* The official maimai score site lets you favourite 20 people and no more:
   "the website lets you favorite up to 20 people ... but you can't have more
   than that" - and, unprompted, "if you make something [to] get around that,
   that would actually be like-". This constant exists so the prototype can
   draw the line and show who falls below it. */

/* Song titles are real maimai tracks rather than invented ones, so the score
   screen reads like the game it is about. Two caveats are worth keeping
   honest, in the same spirit as the venue data:

   - the difficulty is given as its tier (Master, Re:MASTER, Expert) and not as
     a level number, because chart constants move between versions and we have
     not verified them against the current international release
   - the achievement percentages are invented, as are the players

   Clips.

   A feed is in here for one reason: watching is already what these players do
   with the wait. Asked what he does while queued, one player answered "watch
   videos", and the interviewer noted "I'm guessing that's the general trend."
   The problem is that they watch somewhere else - "scrolling phones and
   they're not paying attention" - and then miss their turn, which is why
   people keep having to ask "who's next?".

   Putting the watching inside the app that holds your place is what makes the
   feed worth building rather than a borrowed pattern. It is also the on-ramp
   the team said they wanted for people outside the community: the introverted
   player got in by watching first - "I'd watch like my friends play for ages
   ... I was really interested 'cause it looked so cool."
