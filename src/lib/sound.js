/* Sound.

   Feedback from the Week 6 review listed sound alongside colour, motion and
   type as something this stage should carry, so the prototype has a small
   sound set rather than none.

   Everything is synthesised with the Web Audio API. That keeps the repo free
   of audio files, matches the no-assets rule the rest of the prototype
   follows, and suits a rhythm game app: the cues are short musical intervals
   rather than system beeps.

   The set is deliberately small. An earlier version played a click on every
   button, which is not how apps behave: system interfaces are silent on a
   plain tap. Sound is kept for the two moments that carry information you may
   not be looking at the screen for, plus a confirmation when you switch it
   back on.

   Browsers refuse to start audio before a gesture, so the context is created
   lazily on the first sound and resumed if the browser suspended it. Muting is
   remembered per device. */
